       filter:
           This is the default table (if no -t option is passed). It contains the built-in chains INPUT (for packets destined to local sockets), FORWARD (for  packets
           being routed through the box), and OUTPUT (for locally-generated packets).

       nat:
           This  table  is  consulted when a packet that creates a new connection is encountered.  It consists of three built-ins: PREROUTING (for altering packets as
           soon as they come in), OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing), and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are about to go  out).
           IPv6 NAT support is available since kernel 3.7.

       mangle:
           This  table  is  used  for specialized packet alteration.  Until kernel 2.4.17 it had two built-in chains: PREROUTING (for altering incoming packets before
           routing) and OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing).  Since kernel 2.4.18, three other built-in chains are  also  supported:  INPUT
           (for  packets  coming  into the box itself), FORWARD (for altering packets being routed through the box), and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are
           about to go out).

       raw:
           This table is used mainly for configuring exemptions from connection tracking in combination with the NOTRACK target.  It registers at the netfilter  hooks
           with  higher  priority  and is thus called before ip_conntrack, or any other IP tables.  It provides the following built-in chains: PREROUTING (for packets
           arriving via any network interface) OUTPUT (for packets generated by local processes)

       security:
           This table is used for Mandatory Access Control (MAC) networking rules, such as those enabled by the SECMARK and  CONNSECMARK  targets.   Mandatory  Access
           Control  is  implemented by Linux Security Modules such as SELinux.  The security table is called after the filter table, allowing any Discretionary Access
           Control (DAC) rules in the filter table to take effect before MAC rules.  This table provides the following built-in chains: INPUT (for packets coming into
           the box itself), OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing), and FORWARD (for altering packets being routed through the box).
